Algorithm
Starting with 1mile squares
if we are above or below the equator
divide latitude into 1 mile buckets, save the demarcation value into array
find out what latitude bucket the user falls into
Find out what the circumference is at that latitude
figure out what each mile is in degrees longitude for a that circumference circumference
divide 360 by value to get buckets. 

hash the value you get to find what room user should be put into
